This course provides a broad survey introducing the many layers of the
computer science discipline, emphasizing the computerâ€™s role and
limitations as a tool for describing, organizing, and manipulating
information applicable to many disciplines. Topics include binary logic
expressed in electronic circuitry, machine architecture, basic
programming in the very accessible language Python, data organization,
the potential and limitations of machines, and useful tools.

This course serves as a terminal course for students who want a
one-course introduction to the field, as well as a preliminary course to
upper-level computer science offerings.
