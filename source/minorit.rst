Minor in Information Technology
===============================

Overview
--------

This minor prepares students who plan to design, create, and administer large
information bases used by organizations.

Enterprises have an ever-growing investment in the exploding quantity of
information, especially in web related data, that requires increasingly
sophisticated approaches for efficient access and productive use. Students gain
the talents and skills to be successful in todayâ€™s organizations following
current industry practices: planning, designing, implementing and administering
data information and knowledge bases that can be effectively mined; assessing
the information and data requirements of an organization and implementing these
requirements as an information system; and functioning as an effective member
of an information services division in an organization.
