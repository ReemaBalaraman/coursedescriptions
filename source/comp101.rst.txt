Description
--------------------

This one-credit course offers non-computer science majors an introduction to the use of the vast resources available on the Internet. The course will be taught in a laboratory environment with practical hands-on instruction. Most of the material in this course is included in Comp 120: Introduction to Computer Applications; a student will not be permitted to take both for credit. The scope of the other course is much broader; there are many students who wish to acquire only Internet skills without examining other uses of computers.

Outcome

Students will be able to establish their own web resources.
